    "in the code would be visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding the notion of timing to observables can be done, again conceptually, in two ways:\n",
    "  1) Having some conceptual stopwatch that commences with the starting observable and ends\n",
    "     with the terminating observable. The operation of the stopwatch being instantaneous.\n",
    "  2) Associating a timestamp with the observables and taking their difference. This is subject to \n",
    "     concerns around measurement in different clock domains (clock skew, drift etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases detection of non-completion is needed. \n",
    "In some cases failure might be explicit (and as such a suitable 'failed' observable\n",

    "This brings up the general point about outcomes, that they have a finite period of usefullness.\n",
    "It may be long (before the heat death of the universe) or much shorter - but they are finite.\n",
