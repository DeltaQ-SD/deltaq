This module brings data types and functions
for &#8710;Q System Development into scope.

Specifically,

    * type classes in &quot;DeltaQ.Class&quot;

        * 'Outcome' for outcomes and their combinations
        * 'DeltaQ' for probability distribution of completion times

    * type class instance in &quot;DeltaQ.PiecewisePolynomial&quot;

        * @'DQ'@ for a probability distribution with numeric type @Rational@.
        This type represents a mixed discrete / continuous probability distribution
        where the continuous part is represented in terms of piecewise polynomials.

    * common methods for analysis and construction in &quot;DeltaQ.Methods&quot;

    * plotting utilities in &quot;DeltaQ.Plot&quot;

        * 'plotCDFWithQuantiles' for plotting an instance of 'DeltaQ'
        with quantiles highlighted.

In order to demonstrate the use of this module,
we explore a __real-world example__
which occurred during the design of the Cardano blockchain.

Problem: We want to design a __computer network__
through which we can send a __message__
from any computer A to any other computer Z.

However, instead of connecting each pair of computers through a direct
TCP/IP link, we want to save on connection cables
and only connect each computer to a fixed number of other computers;
these computers are called /neighbors/ and
this number is called the /node degree/ @d@ of our network.
A message from computer A to computer Z will
first be sent to one of the @d@ neighbors of A,
then be __relayed__ to one of the neighbor's neighbors,
and so on until it reaches Z.
hrough the network.

How much __time__ does it take to send the message
from computer A to computer Z through the network?
How should we choose the parameter @d@ in order to improve this time?
How can we refine the network design in other ways?

This questions can be answered by using this module.

@
import DeltaQ
@

We start with an __estimate__ based on __measured__ transfer times.
Depending on geographic distance and location,
a __direct TCP/IP connection__ may delive a message within
different amounts of time.
We distinguish between `short`, `medium` and `long` distance.
For sending a block of 64k bytes of data,
representative times are (in seconds)

&gt; short, medium, long :: DQ
&gt; short  = wait 0.024 -- seconds
&gt; medium = wait 0.143 -- seconds
&gt; long   = wait 0.531 -- seconds

(These are delay times for the data to arrive,
not roundtrip times for the sending computer to receive
an acknowledgment.)

If we assume that a direct TCP/IP connection between computers has
an equal probability of being `short`, `medium`, or `long`,
the probability distribution of delay times for a __single hop__ is

&gt; hop :: DQ
&gt; hop = choices [(1/3, short), (1/3, medium), (1/3, long)]

The distribution of delay times for a __sequence of hops__ is

&gt; hops :: Int -&gt; DQ
&gt; hops 1 = hop
&gt; hops n = hop .&gt;&gt;. hops (n-1)

For example, the probability of five hops to succeed within 2 seconds
is

&gt; &gt; fromRational (successWithin (hops 5) 2) :: Double
&gt; 0.9547325102880658
