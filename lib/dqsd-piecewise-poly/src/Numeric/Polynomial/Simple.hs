We define a polynomial over a numeric type as a list of coefficients
of that type for increasing powers of the variable.
An empty list is not allowed: a zero polynomical must have at least one (zero) element.

We use Sturm's Theorem to count the number of roots of a polynomial in a given interval.
(See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturm%27s_theorem)
Starting from polynomial p, construct the Sturm sequence p0, p1, . . ., where:
p0 = p
p1 = p′
pi+1 = −rem(pi−1, pi) for i > 1
where p′ is the derivative of p and rem(p, q) is the remainder of the Euclidian division of p by q.
The length of this sequence is at most the degree of p.
We define V(x) to be the number of sign variations in the sequence of numbers p0(x), p1(x), . . ..
Sturm’s theorem states that, if p is a square-free polynomial (one without repeated roots), then
R(l,r](p) = V (l) − V (r). This extends to non-square-free polynomials provided neither l nor r is a
multiple root of p (a circumstance we shall ignore)

We start from the tuple that emerges from disagregation.
